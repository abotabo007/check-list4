# üöó Fleet Inspections

Fleets is a modern web application designed to help companies efficiently track fleet inspections, issues, and maintenance.  
The motivation came from seeing traditional paper-based inspections at my company‚Äîmaking it tedious to track vehicle maintenance and usage.  
This app was inspired by the CS50 Week 9 "finance" project and is built with Flask.

- **Roles and permissions**: Owner, Admin, and User with distinct access levels
- **Vehicle management**: Add, edit, or scan vehicle VINs (barcode scanning support)
- **Inspection tracking**: Digital checklists with automatic prompts for issues
- **Maintenance projections**: Upcoming maintenance alerts and visual graphs
- **Responsive design**: Usable on desktop and mobile devices
- **Basic automated tests** for main workflows
